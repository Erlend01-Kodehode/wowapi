1. Idea
No unique idea. Random fetch page with comprehensive filters. Maybe good CSS.

2. Plan
TOOLS = {
    AND = {
        VSCode
        HTML
        CSS
        JavaScript
        ReactJS
        Github
        Owen_Wilson_Wow_Api = {
            OR = {
                Random_Wow
                Ordered_Wow
            }
        }
    }
}

COMPONENTS = {
    AND = {
        ReactJS
        App // Fetching and data handling = {
            AND = {
                Header // Filters
                Body // Content - Results
            }
        }
        api.js // Api Variables
    }
}

Order:

Setup
Program Api
Filters
Display Results
CSS
Eval

TIME = {
    Day1 = {
        Planning = 02:30
        Setup = 03:30
    }
    Day2 = {
        Configure API = 03:00
        Configure Filters = 03:00
    }
    Day3 = {
        Time loss due to outstanding committments = 01:00
        Complete API Data handling = 02:30
        DOM display API result = 02:30
    }
    Day4 = {
        Finish functionality = 02:30
        CSS = 03:30
        Eval = Remaining Time
    }
    Day5 = {
        Functionality = Flexible
        Eval = Flexible
    }
    Day6+ = {
        Whatever needs doing = Flexible
    }
}

Thoughts:
Haven't made a frontend page in a while. Need to clean off the rust.

3. Execution

4. Evaluation
Effort:
A combination of not having made a frontend site in a while, interviews distracting me, a wicked headache at the end of the project and a general lack of motivation means that this task did not get the focus it deserved.
It was fun to get up and running once how making a site started to come back to me, but I never took the time to configure the search filters I wanted.
Hoping now that I've gotten frontend somewhat back into my fingers, future projects will get more care.

Planning:
Atrocious planning. I never got past the "fetch results" stage of what the website should do. Due to the concept being super simple, I never gave the layout much thought beyond displaying results as cards.
Not wireframing an Idea into Figma and doing all of the CSS last resulted in a messy website construction.

Would prioritise creating a wireframe and page structure first before going in to code.
